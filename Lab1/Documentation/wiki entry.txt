There were 3 assignments for this lab.

The first was a program to take a user entry and determine if the number was odd or even.
The program asked for the user to enter a number.
Then using the remainer of dividing by 2 to determine if the number is odd or even, it gave output based on odd or even.

The second was a program to take the height and width, given by the user, to determine area and perimeter of a rectangle.
*Note: the example given in the assignment was incosistant. Height and width were 10 and 6, Tgiving a perimeter of 60. Since this is the area, I decided to ouput both area and perimeter.
The program asked for the user to enter numbers for height and width.
Then it calculated area and perimeter using standard formulas.
Then it gave output based on these calculations.

The third was a program to generate a random number and get the user to guess the number.
*Note: I decided to make the user guess until correct.
The program uses the random function to generate an integer 0-9. 
Then it goes into a while loop until the user guesses the number.
The program asks the user to guess a number.
It compares the number to the randomly generated number.
If it is too high, it outputs such and repeats the loop.
If it is too low, it outputs such and repeats the loop.
If it is correct, it outputs such and leaves the loop.
